# HW-13-E-Commerce

For this project, a back end was built for an e-commerce site. Express.js API was configured to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## Installation

Install packages with: "npm i". You will then need to input "mysql -u root -p", and enter your password when prompted. You will then source the schema with "source db/schema.sql", then "exit" to get back to command line. Seed the database with "npm run seed", then initialize the app with "node server.js". It will then be active on localhost.
